[{"categories":null,"content":"Nowadays have a website for our portfolio or blogging is necessary to improve our digital presence and share our interest to the world. Fortunately there are a lot of options to create our own website from paid to free. This time I want to share how to create website with hugo for free. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators, it use golang as its language which make it the fastest framework for building website. Hugo have a huge community since it is an open-source static site generator and have a lot of themes for a start. You can check all of the free themes here themes.gohugo.io For this example I already find a theme that I like, which is LoveIt-Theme. It is simple, clean, fast and also responsive with a lot of feature. Anyway you can check the complete guide from loveit theme to start from scratch here LoveIt-Documentation The requirement : Git Go Hugo extended foo@bar:~$ go version foo@bar:~$ go version go1.20.4 windows/amd64 foo@bar:~$ git version foo@bar:~$ git version 2.40.1.windows.1 foo@bar:~$ hugo new site my_website foo@bar:~$ cd my_website ","date":"2023-06-04","objectID":"/create-and-deploy-website-for-free-with-hugo/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Create and Deploy Website for Free With Hugo","uri":"/create-and-deploy-website-for-free-with-hugo/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Common practice in cloning and work around git is using SSH, but sometimes setup SSH is a daunting task and troublesome especially for beginner. There is another way to work around git without using SSH that is using HTTPS. If you‚Äôre stuck when setup SSH by facing error that you can‚Äôt solve, I encourage you to use HTTPS, it‚Äôs not a shame to use HTTPS just take it easy. This approach feels more straight to the point to setup and run git. As I know this method can be done in github and bitbucket since I already try both of it. For this example I will guide you using our lovely friend, github.¬†First we have to set our Personal Access Token in github. Go to your github and go to settings. Select the developer settings Open personal access token -\u003e select Tokens (classic) -\u003e Generate new token (Classic) Step 3 Set token name as you like Step 4 Check access that you want to give to the token and click generate token Step 5 Save the token since it will only show once. Step 6 Create new repository in your github and follow these steps to create new repo or push the existing one Step 7 And now the final step in our local repo. The example below is for project that does not have git in it. First initialize git in the project folder and setup the remote origin, add your generated token in the https link place it before github.com and add @ after your token. For example if your https link is: https://github.com/wildanoo/hugo_paper.git and your personal access token is: ghp_QAxwhDxMu7aSxNM25vMmucalR6ybsD1wWYTU the remote url should be like this: https://ghp_QAxwhDxMu7aSxNM25vMmucalR6ybsD1wWYTU@github.com/wildanoo/hugo_paper.git Initialize git in your project folder and add the remote origin url foo@bar:~$ git init foo@bar:~$ git remote add origin https://ghp_QAxwhDxMu7aSxNM25vMmucalR6ybsD1wWYTU@github.com/wildanoo/hugo_paper.git You can check your remote url that you just add before. foo@bar:~$ git remote -v origin https://ghp_QAxwhDxMu7aSxNM25vMmucalR6ybsD1wWYTU@github.com/wildanoo/hugo_paper.git (fetch) origin https://ghp_QAxwhDxMu7aSxNM25vMmucalR6ybsD1wWYTU@github.com/wildanoo/hugo_paper.git (push) And now you can commit and push to your repo without always input username and pass, just like using SSH. foo@bar:~$ git add . foo@bar:~$ git commit -m \"init hugo paper\" foo@bar:~$ git push --set-upstream origin master Cheers! üç∫üç∫ ","date":"2023-05-23","objectID":"/using-github-bitbucket/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Using Http In Git Just Like SSH","uri":"/using-github-bitbucket/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Hi and welcome..
